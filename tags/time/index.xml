      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;he-moved-over-to-the-window&#34;&gt;He moved over to the window&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed) but there was no way of shutting it off completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
