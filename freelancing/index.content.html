    From time to time I help clients to making the most of their data.
    In the following I present a related non-complete list of tools that 
    I'm experienced in.

    <li>self-written Python scripts using Numpy, Scipy and pandas</li>

    My consultation entails solving problems in multiple layers of abstraction.

</ul>
