<h1>About me//</h1>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Ben and I'm currently doing a PhD in physics at 
    <a href="http://rocs.hu-berlin.de/" target="_blank">Dirk Brockmann's lab</a> in Berlin.
    I'm located at the <a href="https://www.rki.de" target="_blank">Robert-Koch Institut</a> 
    but am also affiliated with HU Berlin's 
    <a href="https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de" target="_blank">physics department</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.iri-ls.hu-berlin.de/en" target="_blank">IRI Life Sciences</a>.
</p>
<p>
    My research interest lies in identifying the underlying processes of human contact facilitating
    the spread of diseases. In particular I'm investigating the influence of structural 
    properties of human
    contact networks or human transport networks, both of static and dynamic nature.
